# Oil Production: Bar Plot

![Bad Graph](oil_graph.jpg)

## Why is it a bad graph?

1. **Overcrowded Information**: If it was an attempt to include too much information on or within the original graph at once, such as too many countries or highly detailed categories, the viewer gets overwhelmed and has a hard time getting certain key points with just a glance.

2. **Poor Visual Encoding**: The original graph could be encoding the data with an inappropriate or inefficient visualization, such as:
   Displaying 3D charts, usually distorting the true value comparisons.

   Inappropriate use of color scale, through which the variation of     values cannot be perceived.

   This would include a failure to arrange data in a logical order that would allow for easy comparison between countries regarding oil production.

3. **Lack of Focus on Comparison**: It is not clear from the graph how the countries compare in their oil production, which is likely the most important insight to be derived from the data. If the graph isn't sorted or uses inconsistent scales, the viewer can't readily tell which countries produce the most oil.
4. **Geographical Blindness**: A chart that does not adopt geographical context because of its original nature does not present oil production on the geographic perspective. Oil production is highly related to geography, thus a lack of geographical perspective limits the insight a viewer gains from the data.

##2. Why is Geospatial Map good?

Adding Geographical Context another major failing of the original graph is the lack of geo context, which is addressed by a **geospatial map**.

**Spatial Representation:** Conveys visually on a geospatial map where, in the world, oil production is happening. Because countries are shaded based on their relative oil production, one can readily observe regional trends, such as high production in the Middle East or North America.

**Regional Comparability:** Adding a geographical dimension to this map helps the user judge the global distribution of oil production. You can tell instantly, for example, which regions are responsible for the bulk of the world's oil, something you could not get from the bar plot by itself.

**Visualize the trend in a global perspective:** The map will help view the significance of regions relying on the production of oil in their various countries by showing it on a global outlook to pinpoint regional "hotspots" where the production of oil occurs.
